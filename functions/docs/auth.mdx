# Authentication
The API is publically available through the [NLOD licence](https://data.norge.no/nlod/no), 
however, it is required that all consumers identify themselves by using the header 
`ET-Client-Name`. Entur will deploy strict rate-limiting policies on API-consumers 
who do not identify themselves with a header, and reserves the right to block 
unidentified consumers. The structure of the value of `ET-Client-Name` should be: 
"company - application"

Header examples:
- "brakar - journeyplanner"
- "fosen_utvikling - infoplakat"
- "norway_bussekspress - reiseplanlegger"
